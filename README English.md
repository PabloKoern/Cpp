# ðŸ“˜ C++ â€” EVERYTHING DEVELOPED IN THIS LANGUAGE

This repository contains my personal notes and code from university courses:
- **Algorithms and Programming**
- **Data Structures**
- **Coming soon**

All examples are written in `C++` and organized by topic for better clarity and progress tracking.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

`Fundamentals of C++, Algorithms, and Programming/`
   - `00_intro`: First steps, syntax, basic output
   - `01_conditionals/`: `if`, `else`, nested logic
   - `02_loops/`: `while`, `for`, control flow
   - `03_arrays_matrices/`: One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
   - `04_sorting_searching/`: Bubble sort, linear/binary search
   - `05_strings_structs/`: String manipulation and struct usage
   - `Test`: Exams based on all the content
